DEVELOPMENT VERSION. DO NOT USE FOR LIVE. MAKE CHANGES AND MINIFY.

For themes, swap the color palette. With light themes, use xyz. With dark themes, use zyx.
All color values are HSL/A. Please keep this consistent.

Why HSL/A? This is a significantly easier way to work with color.
- H = What hue you want between 0 and 360. Red at 0, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple and Red at 360.
- S = What saturation you want between 0% (dull) and 100% (vibrant).
- L = What lightness you want between 0% (dark) an 100% (bright).
- And if A is specified, what opacity you want between 0% (transparent) and 100% (opaque).

The invalid media target below will allow you to see all the colors used in the CSS with editors
that support live color picking and previews. Such as VS Code and Dreamweaver.
